# Play2EarnX Project Documentation

<!-- Read the full tutorial here: **[>> How to build a Decentralized Game Platform with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Solidity](https://daltonic.github.io)** -->

The project revolves around `Play2EarnX.sol`, a Solidity-written Ethereum smart contract. It leverages the OpenZeppelin library to ensure secure and standardized development of the contract.

The core of the contract is defined by four primary structures: `GameStruct`, `PlayerStruct`, `InvitationStruct`, and `ScoreStruct`, representing a game, a player, an invitation, and a score, respectively.

## Key Features

- `createGame`: Allows a user to create a new game.
- `deleteGame`: Allows the game owner to delete a game.
- `invitePlayer`: Allows a user to invite another player to a game.
- `acceptInvitation`: Allows a user to accept an invitation to a game.
- `rejectInvitation`: Allows a user to reject an invitation to a game.
- `payout`: Distributes payouts to the winners of a game.
- `saveScore`: Records a player's score in a game.

## Running the Application

Supply the following keys in your `.env` variable:

```sh
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8545
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_ID=<YOUR_ALCHEMY_PROJECT_ID>
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID=<WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID>
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=somereallysecretsecret
```

`YOUR_ALCHEMY_PROJECT_ID`: [Get Key Here](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/)
`WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID`: [Get Key Here](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-in)

Follow these steps to run the application:

1. Install the package modules by running the command: `yarn install`
2. Start the Hardhat server: `yarn blockchain`
3. Run the contract deployment script: `yarn deploy`
4. Run the contract seeding script: `yarn seed`
5. Spin up the Next.js development server: `yarn dev`

Now, your application should be up and running.
